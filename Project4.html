<h2>The History</h2>
<!--The history of Sultan's Palace is quiet scary.-->

<p>In 1836, Sultan's Palace was built on the corner of Dauphine Street and Orleans Avenue. This luxurious Greek home was bought by a Turkish man and at night, the house came alive with music, young women, and parties. As suspicion of the palace grew, one day there was blood seen seeping down the walls, steps, and sidewalks. What they found in the house was even worse. Women, men, and children's body parts were found. Even Sultan's brother was found buried alive in the backyard, and was suspected to be killed by Sultan. The palace house is now said to be haunted because of this mass murder.</p>
